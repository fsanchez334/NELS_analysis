## Importing Libraries

In the following block of code, I am importing the libraries that are
going to be useful for the six hypothesis testing

``` r
library("readxl")
```

    ## Warning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.1.3

``` r
library("tidyverse")

## First Hypothesis Test: T-test comparing Expected Income of Males and Females Who Took AP Exams

Following the above hypothesis, in the following block of code, I am
comparing the expected income of males and females who took AP exams

``` r
my_data <- read_excel("RStats_ProjectII.xlsx", sheet = "Subset_AP")

#Makes boolean to create dataframe that contain males who took the AP Exams
male_bool_yesap <- (my_data["Gender"] == "Male") & (my_data["AP_Test_Taken"] == "Yes")
female_bool_yesap <- (my_data["Gender"] == "Female") & (my_data["AP_Test_Taken"] == "Yes")

male_yesap <- my_data[male_bool_yesap,]
female_yesap <- my_data[female_bool_yesap,]
#Merges the dataframes of male and females 
container <- merge(male_yesap, female_yesap, all = TRUE)

#Boxplot formed
ggplot(container) + geom_boxplot(width=.4, aes(x = AP_Test_Taken , y = Expected_income_at_age_30 , colour = Gender)) + ggtitle("Expected Income by Age 30 of Females and Males Who Took an AP Exam ")
```

## Second Hypothesis Chi Square Test:Teacher Perception and Average Performances

In this hypothesis test, I am determining if there is a relationship
between how a student perceives a child and the average performance of
that student during high school

``` r
# Information from excel sheet is read
average_perception <- read_excel("RStats_ProjectII.xlsx", sheet = "P")

#Table is produced
tablelized <- table(average_perception)
tablelized
```

    ##                                averages_classifications
    ## converted_df.teacher_perception Above Average Below Average
    ##               Agree                       722           750
    ##               Disagree                     83            89
    ##               Strongly Agree              166           158
    ##               Strongly Disagree            20            12

``` r
#Chi Square Test is Performed
chisq.test(average_perception$converted_df.teacher_perception, average_perception$averages_classifications)
```

    ## 
    ##  Pearson's Chi-squared test
    ## 
    ## data:  average_perception$converted_df.teacher_perception and average_perception$averages_classifications
    ## X-squared = 2.7777, df = 3, p-value = 0.4272

``` r
#There is no relationship between average performance of students and what their teachers perceive of them 
```

## Third Hypothesis: Chi Squared Test: Type of High School Program and Time Spent on Homework

The following block of code determines if there is a relationship
between the type of high school program and the time spent on homework

``` r
#Gets dataframe from excel sheet and converts it into a table 
school_type_hw <- read_excel("RStats_ProjectII.xlsx", sheet = "HomeworkTypeHighSchool")
#4-6, 1-3
school_type_hw_bool_1 <- school_type_hw[,"Time Spent on Homework out of School per Week in Twelfth Grade"] == "1-3 Hours"
school_type_hw_bool_4 <- school_type_hw[,"Time Spent on Homework out of School per Week in Twelfth Grade"] == "4-6 Hours"

holder_1 <- school_type_hw[school_type_hw_bool_1,]
holder_4 <- school_type_hw[school_type_hw_bool_4,]

#Now, we must combine both of the dataframes
container <- merge(holder_1, holder_4, all = TRUE)
table(container)
```

    ##                            Time Spent on Homework out of School per Week in Twelfth Grade
    ## Type of High School Program 1-3 Hours 4-6 Hours
    ##           Academic                 67        62
    ##           Other                     6         6
    ##           Rigorous Academic        26        41
    ##           Some Vocational          15         9

``` r
#Chi Squared is performed
chisq.test(container$`Time Spent on Homework out of School per Week in Twelfth Grade`, container$`Type of High School Program`)
```

    ## 
    ##  Pearson's Chi-squared test
    ## 
    ## data:  container$`Time Spent on Homework out of School per Week in Twelfth Grade` and container$`Type of High School Program`
    ## X-squared = 4.9845, df = 3, p-value = 0.1729

## Fourth Hypothesis Testing: Linear Regression: Math Achievement in Eighth Grade vs Math Achievement in Twelfth Grade

In this test, I perform an analysis to see if there is a correlation
between oneâ€™s math performance in eighth grade and their achievement in
twelfth grade

``` r
#Now let's do a linear regression test on the math performance
math_perform <- read_excel("RStats_ProjectII.xlsx", sheet = "MathRegion")
math_perform_model<- lm(Math_Achievement_in_Eighth_Grade ~ Math_Achievement_in_Twelfth_Grade, data = math_perform)
print(math_perform_model)
```

## Fifth Hypothesis Testing Comparison Of Means (t-test): Education Level and Average Performance in High School

In this test, I am comparing the average performance of those students
that are expected to earn bachelorâ€™s against those that are expected to
get a masters degree

``` r
subjects_att_education <- read_excel("RStats_ProjectII.xlsx", sheet = "AveragePerHigh")
subjects_att_education <- subjects_att_education[, c("Highest_Education_Expected", "Average_Performance_Overall")]

#Let's find the average performance between Bachelors and PHD and make appropriate 
bachelors_bool <- subjects_att_education["Highest_Education_Expected"] == "Bachelor's Degree"
masters_bool <- subjects_att_education["Highest_Education_Expected"] == "Master's Degree"

bachelors_df <- subjects_att_education[bachelors_bool,]
masters_df <- subjects_att_education[masters_bool,]

#Getting the summary stats for bachelor's
summary(bachelors_df$Average_Performance_Overall)
```

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.

## Sixth Hypothesis Testing T-Test For Reading Achievement Between Public and Private, Non-Religious Schools

In this test, I am comparing the eighth grade reading achievement of
students attending public and private, non-religious schools

``` r
#T-test for the reading achievement (Public, Private, Non-Religious)
school_8th_reading <-read_excel("RStats_ProjectII.xlsx", sheet = "Reading8th")
