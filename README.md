#### Exploring Relationships from National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) Dataset Pertaining to Eighth Graders in 1988

## Purpose of Analysis
The data I will be analyzing centers around data gathered from high school students in 1988 in the United States. After looking at the data, one important question to ask is “What factors are associated with student achievement during high school and afterward?” Whether that come from a parent or student, the question calls for analyzing the factors that can best maximize a student’s potential. Undoubtedly, there is inequity in the quality of education and a mismatch between academic education and a student’s prospects. Part of this study aims to see which variables play the heaviest role in determining how a student performs throughout high school – that way, such findings can help inform the public which variables to pay greater attention in order to improve our student’s performance.


## Methods of Analysis
For my analysis, there were several variables that I took into consideration. Those are: Gender, whether students were enrolled in an AP Program, Expected Income at age 30, School Type, Reading Achievement, Highest Education Expected, Average Performance Overall, Income Classification, Math Achievement in 8th grade, Math Achievement in Twelfth Grade, Geographic Region of the School, Teacher’s Interest in Students, Average Classification, Parent’s Marital Status, Science Improvement Overall, Urbanicity, Time Spent on Homework, and the type of High School Program. While this list of variables is not exhaustive, the list is sufficient for a holistic analysis of factors relating to the success of a student.

After conducting an exploratory analysis in part one, I conduct hypothesis testing on six to seven relationships I uncovered in my first analysis.
